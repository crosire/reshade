ReShade
=======

This is a generic post-processing injector for games and video software. It exposes an automated way to access both frame color and depth information and a custom shader language called ReShade FX to write effects like ambient occlusion, depth of field, color correction and more which work everywhere.

ReShade can optionally load add-ons, DLLs that make use of the ReShade API to extend functionality of both ReShade and/or the application ReShade is being applied to. To get started on how to write your own add-on, check out the [documentation in the include directory of this repository](include/README.md).

The ReShade FX shader compiler contained in this repository is standalone, so can be integrated into other projects as well. Simply add all `source/effect_*.*` files to your project and use it similar to the [fxc example](tools/fxc.cpp).

## Building

You'll need Visual Studio 2017 or higher to build ReShade and Python for the `gl3w` dependency.

1. Clone this repository including all Git submodules
2. Open the Visual Studio solution
3. Select either the `32-bit` or `64-bit` target platform and build the solution.\
   This will build ReShade and all dependencies. To build the setup tool, first build the `Release` configuration for both `32-bit` and `64-bit` targets and only afterwards build the `Release Setup` configuration (does not matter which target is selected then).
