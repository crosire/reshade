{35MM} [Reshade 4.0]
Depth Buffer may hang for a second if you move your view too fast. Hope ReShade 4.4 fixes this.

{.Hack//G.U.} [Reshade 3.0.8]
Once you install Reshade, install this fix that allows for depth buffer access. This fix uses 3DMigoto to disable a shader that was blocking acess to the depth buffer.
http://www.mediafire.com/file/d5ep3qlsnbbbmvl/dotHack%20GU%20fix%20for%20Depth3D.zip

{A Plague Tale: Innocence} [Reshade 4.7.0]
So we are going to remove some post-process effects that affect the 3D Image in a negative way.

Befor everything, please launch the game and set your settings then exit the game, then locate ENGINESETTINGS below.

The Config file is located at: [User]\Documents\My Games\A Plague Tale Innocence\

Open the ENGINESETTINGS file with a text editor and set following options:

DOF
  Enabled 1 Change the value from 1 to 0
MotionBlur
  Enabled 1 Change the value from 1 to 0
PostProcess
  Fringe 1 Change the value from 1 to 0
  LensDistortion 1 Change the value from 1 to 0
  FilmGrain 1 Change the value from 1 to 0

You can also change a few other things like Bloom and Vignette, but it's up to you.

Save the file. You may want to set the permission to read-only.

{Alan Wake} [Reshade 4.7.0]
Install game and before you launch it add -noblur to your launch options.
Set you settings in game and notice the locked MSAA. Just leave it at 2x. Save your settings and close the game.

I suggest you use alpha mode in SuperDepth3D for this game and Alan Wake's American Nightmare.

You will not need to do this for the sequel. Make sure you turn off this injector for any other game. 
Please note most AV's will detect this as a threat.

{Alien Isolation} [Reshade 4.7.0]
The shader corrects for the Distortion that the game causes.

This can be dissabled if you use the https://github.com/aliasIsolation/aliasIsolation/releases if you set CA to 0.000
But, If you use this TAA mod you can't disable motion blur. This is an issue. Anyways, dissable the distortion correction at the bottom of the shader.

Motion sickness can happen if you use the TAA mod with motion blur.

Also to remove EyeBall all Lens Flares

Go to the DATA folder of the game.
Delete or rename the LENS_FLARE*.bin files.

or

That removes only the Sun Flare.

{Amnesia: Games} [Reshade 4.1.0]
Issue with ReShade 4.0.0+ If you install ReShade as opengl32.dll you have to rename it to dxgi.dll in the game folder. Windows 10 Issue it seems.

Also Make sure to disable the insanity post process effect. It messes with the 3D in the game.

{Bard's Tale 4} [Reshade 4.7.0]
Annoying issue if you read any notice in game you have to set your Depth Adjust ammount from 20 to 200-250 (I use 225). If this issue was not there this would had been an
easy game to play. It seems to get stuck like this so not bad bad..... only one time bad :D

Anyways I advise you to set it back to 20 if you're going to turn off the game and set it to 200-250 once you encounter a Notice in game. Well, please enjoy.

{Battlefield One} [Reshade 4.0.2]
Added alternate settings mode to my shader. This can be done with the newly added Alternate Depth Buffer Adjust Toggle PREPROCESSOR FUNCTIONS. This is in Shader.
Ex. FPS mode will be around 7.50. But, For Tank mode you want to use around 20.0.

Please Note:
If you run AMD and have a 2nd GPU in your system like an Nvidia Card. Reshade will crash this game on start up.

{BattleTech}
Read the section for Dealing with mouse pointer issues, at the top. 

{Batman Arkham Asylum} [Reshade 4.4.0]
In older versions of Reshade you may encounter Depth Flickering.

{Batman Arkham Knight}
Depth Buffer seems to drop off in some locations. As reported, this is a Reshade issue not a SuperDepth3D Issue.

{Dementium 2} [Reshade 4.4.0]
You have to mess with the Depth Buffer options to get it to work. Not perfect. Kind of strange not all Reshade filters work.

{Black Mesa} [Reshade 3.2.1]
So in newer versions of Reshade 4.4.0+ you need to set in-game MSAA to on. To do this, open the console and enter the command:
mat_antialias 2

This should allow Reshade to grab the Depth buffer in game. On a side note you should install Reshade in to the
SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Black Mesa\bin folder.

{BoarderLands 2}
Use a controller or keyboard for menu navigation.
Mouse and keyboard is good for gameplay. 
Use Cross_Cursor for navigation with mouse.

{Bioshock Remastred}
In the game settings you would need to dissable Real Time Reflections and use the DLL listed here.

https://reshade.me/forum/releases/3744-3-1?start=200#26443

{Blood: Fresh Suppy} [Reshade 4.5.3]
If you're going to play this game make sure you do in Opengl32 or Vulkan since they offer better depth buffers than DX11.

I would just use Opengl32 for MSAA.

{Blood Crossmatching}
Get it here http://m210.duke4.net/index.php/files/viewdownload/3-eduke32/38-blood-crossmatching

Install Reshade 3.0.4. This is needed to use some lighting & shadows. But, if you don't care for lighting use the newest one.
Install as Direct 3D 10+ so you don't delete opengl32.dll. 
This or install opengl and override opengl32.dll and use a bloom shader from Reshade.
Install to \BloodCM\distr

Once that is done you can now install High-Resolution Textures Pack for BloodCM game.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bloodcmhrp/

Put xhrp_05fix.zip and zip archives in \BloodCM\autoload folder and check "Enable autoload folder" checkbox in eduke32 setup window. 
If you don't want to use the textures just disable them in-game, that way you can still have the 3D models.

Now the last thing is to start the game and set your settings.

To help fix the depth buffer with lighting & shadows use Console command r_pr_maxlightpasses "1".
This will limit the amount of lights processed per surface. Seems to be a hard bug to fix in eduke32.
So I don't think this will get fixed anytime soon.

{Blood 2} [Reshade 4.0.2]
You need DGVooDoo2 installed with the following settings and information:
First Start DGVoodoo "2.62.3" Control Panel.

Right click the dgVoodoo logo and click on "SHOW ALL SECTIONS OF THE CONFIGURATION."
Now look for Config folder /Running instance, click "Add" and guide it to your GOG Games "Blood 2" folder.
-=General=- 
	+Output API: Best 
	Appearance

Apply settings then hit OK.

Once you are done with that, go back to the dgVoodoo folder and open the MS folder - x86. Copy D3DImm.dll and DDraw.dll into your GOG Games "Blood 2" folder. 

Now Install my "Blood2 Patch for Depth 3D." http://www.mediafire.com/file/3mxvwci29qi0fqp/Blood2PatchDepth3D%2BMods.zip

Click on my included .bat files to start the game.
Depth3D_Blood2_Nightmare_Start.bat
or
Depth3D_Blood2_Start.bat

// May not need this part.
Windows 10 issues black box only audio workaround.
You will have to click my .bat file then click again on the black window before the game launches, then alt-tab back to the the game.

AMD White Texture work around. Find detailhi.cfg in the Blood 2 folder and set MipmapOffset to 1.000000
You will lose a lot of texture detail. I do not recommend playing like this.

Now For Mods you will have click on the Bat files provided.

{BuildGDX}  [Reshade 4.7.0, note: used Xenos to inject]
Download https://github.com/DarthTon/Xenos/releases and the latest version of Reshade.

Create a folder and extract Xenos 2.3.2. You only really need the Xenos.exe 64 bit program and also extract Reshade 64bit ReShade64.dll into the same folder
as Xenos. Place SuperDepth3D with Overwatch.fxh in this folder and start Xenos.exe.

Click on Manual Launch radio button.
Click on Add and select the ReShade64.dll.
Click on Select and find the BuildGDX.exe.

Now click Inject, then launch your game like normal.

BloodGDX... Set Depth Offset to 0.990 ot 1.000. You can also increase Seperation from 0.005 to 0.105

{Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019} [Reshade 4.4.2]
First of all please set the game's Shadow Map Resolution to Normal. Also, make sure you turn off DOF and Motion Blur.

Next, follow this YouTube video to set Reshade Depth Buffer Settings.
https://youtu.be/JzkgHkXRMCg

You have to reset setting in the depth buffer tab and then set it to D16 and restart your game and follow the strange ritual again. 

Your game may and most likely will crash when you uncheck the 2nd option.

Also no real way to fix the 1-frame delay due to issues in this game.

4.7.0 Fixes the Issues but then they break again in 4.9.1

Use ReShade 4.7.0. DXR works with a strange Box on the top left and it goes away if you use DLSS. But, it's a lower quality Depth Buffer.
Have Fun.

{Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3}
Set Image Quality to Native.
You can also use DGVoodoo 2.6 to make the game DX11 and grab a better depth buffer, maybe.

{Call of Duty: Advance Warfare}
Render Resolution Native.
Turn off AA.
Don't use in game Supersampling
FOV Sucks i know.

{Call of Duty: Ghost}
Set Image Quality to Extra.

{Call of Duty: Black Ops 2}
Turn off AA.

{Call of Duty: Black Ops 4}
Game crashes under Nv Hardware.
Use an AMD Card to play this game in 3D.

{Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare}
Render Resolution Native.
Turn off AA.
Don't use in game Supersampling

{Chronicle of Riddick Assault on Dark Athena} [Reshade 4.9.1]
So this game causes strange issues in many shaders. Also has low perf even with my 1080ti. Have no Idea whats going on.

To get the depth buffer you have to enable MSAA 2X or more. Then select the proper Depth in the API tab. 
The game is very unoptimized with anti-aliasing on like really bad....

Big Issue is that it seems to detoggle it self sometimes and in cutscenes Depth don't aline like it should. Maybe I will look in to some sort of fix later for the cutscenes.
But, for now try this. https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Riddick:_Assault_on_Dark_Athena#Widescreen_resolution

Also, Try the other fixes listed on that web page.

Other then that gameplay seems fine. This profile may need some tuning later. Good luck.

Oh wait One more thing it seems like Threaded optimization needs to be turned off for this game in the NVIDIA Control Panel. I didn't test AMD GPUs.

Man this game needs a ReMaster and redone in a diffrent API.......


{Cloud Punk} [Reshade 4.9]
Once you install Reshade. Install this fix that allows for depth buffer access. This fix uses 3DMigoto to disable a shader that was blocking acess to the depth buffer.
http://www.mediafire.com/file/25qdu9lurxfucg2/Cloudpunk_fix_for_Depth3D.zip

{Conarium} [Reshade 4.9.1]
Game runs with issues when mental Distortion effects are active. Can't remove them. Other then this it's ok......

To Disable PostProcessing effects in TSoRF

Head over to C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Conarium\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor
Open the “Engine.ini” file

So on here at the bottom.

Add:
[SystemSettings]
r.DepthOfFieldQuality=0
r.MotionBlur.Max=0
r.MotionBlurQuality=0
r.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0
r.SceneColorFringeQuality=0

Save the file and set it to Read Only. 

Keep in mind if you change your setting in game you need to restart so that this INI can remove the problem Post Effects.
{Condemned Criminal Origins} - Used ReShade 4.4
Issues with Depth it will stop after scripted events try to use the newest option at the bottom of depth buffer compatablity for DX9.
Also Dissable FSAA (FSAA OFF) or was it turn it on I forget.
This is bug in game that drops fps in to the single diglets...... you need a pokemon that strong againts ground types.
I kid I kid I don't know how to fix this issue try pc gaming wiki when fps drops in the the single digits.

{Crysis 2} [Reshade 4.9.1]

Go to your

Drive:\Your Games Folder\Crysis 2

look for the system.cfg then drop the autoexec.cfg next to it and you are done.

https://www.mediafire.com/file/fcchg1270vccfwz/Crysis_2.zip/file

{Dead or Alive 6} [Reshade 4.9.1]
To use ReShade in this game you need to use a Injector that was written for UWP Games.

First Download this and then create a folder and drop the following files into the folder. 
https://reshade.me/downloads/inject64.exe

Then download ReShade installer ReShade_Setup.exe from ReShade_Setup.zip extract the files
ReShade64.dll
ReShade64.json

Next grab SuperDepth3D.fx or SuperDepth3D_VR+.fx with Overwatch.fxh and place everything in
this your created folder.

Now hold Left Control + Left Shift and right click and select "Open PowerShell window here."

Now the easy part Drag "inject64.exe" into the blue window. and Type DOA6.exe and hit enter.

Now Just start the game.

{DeadRising 3}
Use Native scailing I think it's called in game as Full.
I also suggest useing the 60FPS and 70-80 FOV Fix for this game.

https://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Dead_Rising_3

{Deadly Premonition}
Can Run with Higer Rez useing DPfix095.
To Use it with Reshade Just Start Up Reshade and Make a profile for it like any other game.

Then head to the folder and rename d3d9.dll to dxgi.dll. 
Now open the DPfix095.zip Directly from http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/DPfix095.zip or http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438.

Install the contents of that folder in to Deadly Premonition Folder where you changed Reshade's d3d9.dll to dxgi.dll. Edit the DPfix.ini too what ever REZ you want. Then start the game.

{Destroy All Humans!} [Reshade 4.7.0]
Game runs fine issues with DoF and/or other effects.

To Disable Depth of Field in DAH!

Head over to C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\DH\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor
Open the “Engine.ini” file
Add:
[SystemSettings]
r.DepthOfFieldQuality=0
r.MotionBlur.Max=0
r.MotionBlurQuality=0
r.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0

For Bloom Add:
r.BloomQuality=0

Save the file Set it to read only. I recommend you set your setting in games first befor all of this.

Now I also say you should use a FOV mod. You can use this game.

https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/1948-destroy-all-humans-fov-changer/

I also recommend you use View Mode set to Alpha. Because of all the Foliage.

{Devil May Cry 5} [Reshade 4.7.0]
Some Issues in game since you can't use most, fixes with out running in "DX12." There is not much you can do.

Go to <path-to-game>
Open dmc5config.ini

In here you can change

DepthOfFiledEnable=true 
to 
DepthOfFiledEnable=false

you can also try to set Fov=90

Save your changes. Not sure it works.

{DOOM - 2016}
Issues with AMD hardware. No depth buffer.

If I am wiling to gues it's because it defaults from Opengl 4.6.0 to 4.3.0 under AMD. Guess you should use a Nv Card for this game. If you know of a way to fix this tell me.

{Dragon Ball FightersZ} [Reshade 3.1.2]
Online 3D works aswell. You need to use ReShade 3.1.2 That is whitelisted under EAC.

{Duke Nukem 3D}
So getting eduke32 working with Polymer HRP and Duke Nukem 3D.

Prerequisites: Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition or Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour
Right now it's on sale at Humble Store.

A. Folder needed either one or the other. Not Both. :p
Duke Nukem 3D
Duke Nukem 3D Twentieth Anniversary World Tour
B. You would also need eduke32 The latest release. www.eduke32.com/
Windows Download
eduke32_latest.7z
Extract, "B 2."
C. Place the contents of eduke32_latest into, "A 1 or A 2."

D. As for the High-Resolution Packs. Get them Here hrp.duke4.net/download.php
Duke3D HRP v5.4 FULL SFX (986 MB) - Self-extracting archive with everything needed to play
Duke3D PSX Highres Sounds v1.11 (7.3 MB)
XXX Pack v1.33 - ;) Why not
E. Extract the ZIP files you need from the packs on top. The files you need should be;
duke3d_hrp.zip
duke3d_music-sc55.zip
duke3d_psx.zip
duke3d_xxx.zip
F. Place "E 1 - 4" into a folder called autoload.

G. Place the autoload folder into, "A 1 or A 2."
Now, go to the autoload folder and extract duke3d_hrp.zip
Open the file go to duke3d_hrp\highres\sprites.def
Now with a basic text editor edit line 5.
Line 5 should look like this. //include highres/sprites/firstperson.def
Save.


H. Now go back and delete "E 1," aka duke3d_hrp.zip

I. Repack the duke3d_hrp folder using zip. I used 7-Zip. Once you have a new duke3d_hrp.zip file you can delete the folder.

J. Install Reshade 3.0.4 This is needed to use some lighting & shadows. But, if you don't care for lighting use the newest one.
ReShade Repository - www.mediafire.com/folder/8ar1jhh1809cl/ReShade_Repository
Install as OpenGL
Place my 3D shader in the folder, "A 1 or A 2." Aka Duke Nukem 3D / Duke Nukem 3D Twentieth Anniversary World Tour
K. Start eduke32.exe in the folder, "A 1 or A 2." Aka Duke Nukem 3D / Duke Nukem 3D Twentieth Anniversary World Tour
Check Polymer, Enable "autoload" folder, and fullscreen if you like.
Set Video mode and Input devices
Click Start
L. Once in game press ` and open console.
Use Console Command r_pr_maxlightpasses "1"
M. Now play the game.

Things to note.
The new version of Duke will have problems. forums.duke4.net/topic/8966-wip-world-to...mpatibility-stopgap/
The reason we have to disable the polymer weapon hands. Is that when it's on the screen it removes the rest of the z-Buffer.
The reason we have to use r_pr_maxlightpasses "1" is to correct a problem with the depth buffer when it set to high.
Using r_pr_maxlightpasses "1" will make the game darker. But, it's ok.
Mirrors in the game have problems avoid them.

Other than that my brain thinks that shooting a 3D projectile from a 2D gun is amazing for some reason.

{Duke Nukem 3D Twentieth Anniversary World Tour} - Use ReShade 3.4.1
Game now works with the new DX11_BUFFER_DETECTION. You can set this also in ReShades DX11 Tab in game.
[DX11_BUFFER_DETECTION]
DepthBufferRetrievalMode=1
DepthBufferTextureFormat=2
ExtendedDepthBufferDetection=1
DepthBufferClearingNumber=3

{Dungeon Nightmares II}
Highest Setting is "Good" Any thing Lower will work and thing above will not work. Make sure to set your res to native.

{Dusk/Dusk World} [Reshade 3.4.0]
In Reshade you need to set the Depth Buffer D32FS8 and Copy Before Clearing. Select Option 4 for World space. Keep in mind your weapond will not be Drawn in this Depth Buffer.
The weapon Depth Buffer can be found on Option 1. But, can't be merged.....

{Dying Light 2} [Reshade 5.0.2] - SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Dying Light 2\ph\work\bin\x64
The shader applys a anti-Barrel Distortion by Default. You have to disable this once you follow the following steps.

Download the mod from https://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglight2/mods/31?tab=files&file_id=1043
This Mod was made by shawnikaros

Your need the Files data4 and Data6.
data4 is to disable Barrel Lens Distortion and DoF.
Data6 is to disable Chromatic Aberration.

you can also download the files from here as back up if the above link does not work.
https://www.mediafire.com/file/8lsyeiwhj8nlrwu/Dying_Light_2_Mod_Depth3D.zip/file

Navigate to SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Dying Light 2\ph\source
Drop the folowing Files data4 and Data6 into this folder. 

Start the game and in ReShade/Depth3D options got to the bottom of the shader setting.

Once here then disable The Barrel Distortion fix in the shader because this mod fixes it better.

{Emily Wants To Play}
Install reshade in to SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Emily Wants To Play\Engine\Binaries\Win64

{F.E.A.R} [Reshade 4.9.1]
Low frame rate issue was noticed use 

Download the DirectInput FPS Fix. https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/file/789-directinput-fps-fix/

Extract into <path-to-game> for the main campaign.

For the expansion packs extract it into <path-to-game>\FEARXP and <path-to-game>\FEARXP2.

For more information go to https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/F.E.A.R.#

{Fallout 4} [Reshade 4.7.0]

Major Note: Copy Depth Buffer Before Clearing needs to be set when you enter the Mech. This also needs to be dissabled when you exit it. Delay Frame don't help here because when
inside the Mech the Depth and BackBuffer are in sync. So best to just switch it in game. I also can't tell if your in the Mech or not.

Go to C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\My Games\Fallout4. Open Fallout4Prefs.ini and then change the following parameters:

//from
[Imagespace] 
Disable DoF
bDoDepthOfField=1
bScreenSpaceBokeh=1

//to
[Imagespace] 
bDoDepthOfField=0
bScreenSpaceBokeh=0

Fix for Mouse Lag in Fallout 4:
Go to C:\Users\[name]\Documents\My Games\Fallout4\ Fallout4.ini / Fallout4Prefs.ini and steamapps\common\Fallout 4\Fallout4\Fallout4Prefs.ini under [Controls] add:

bMouseAcceleration=0

Warning This next one can make your game unstable. Only do this if you can't handle the mouse lag.
\/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/ \/
Go to C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\My Games\Fallout4. Open Fallout4Prefs.ini and then change the following parameters:
//from
iPresentInterval=1
//to
iPresentInterval=0
/\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ /\
Warning This next one can make your game unstable. Only do this if you can't handle the mouse lag.

To be sure, you should also change the iPresentInterval in Fallout4.ini.

Now In games set FOV to something like "fov 90 95" You need to do this each time you start the game or set it in the config file.

A other problem is the Weapon Hand Size it's so big..... I recommend your favorite Lowered Weapons Mod. I use
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20093

{FarCry 2} [Reshade 4.5.2]
Use DX9 for weapon in game. Only think I noticed wrong was the guys hair is missing from the DB. 
You have to use DX9 because it draws the weapon correctly so you can have weapon hand depth.

{FarCry 3} [Reshade 4.5.3]
Ingame setting MSAA 2X should be on to enable Depth Map in DX11. But, Don't use DX11.
Use DX9 because the depth buffer more stable.

In DX9 you may want to use MXAO and SMAA due to the lower quality AO and Alpha AA.
But, Really use DX9.

{FarCry 5} [Reshade 4.4.2]
Reshade version chosen due to EAC
Other things to note you can set FPS Focus Depth if you have issues with aiming with your gun. 
TAA causes shimmering.

{Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition} [Reshade 4.6.1]
Problems with getting to the ReShade console.

You can use Ctrl + Tab then tab to the box you want and hit Spacebar. Then use arrow keys to get to the sharder you want and hit enter. Then do this again for the settings.....

You can also run the game in window mode then alt tab with the reshade menu open. Then Click out side then click back in to the game on top of the ReShade menu. Then close it and switch the game back to Fullscreen mode.

{Gold Source: Games} [Reshade 5.0.2]
When you install the opengl32.dll right click it and set it to read only.
You will also need to launch the game with this launch command.

-nomsaa

Other things that may be wanted is to set. 

default_fov 105

{Gothic 1 & 2 AKA Gold} [Reshade 5.0.0-preview]
Looks like the Steam versions came pre modded. But, you still need a external mod to convert DX8 to DX11 Links are below.

For
Gothic 1.08k_mod 
Use with Kirides Gothic GD3D11 v17.7-dev20 Mod.

For
Gothic 2: Night of the Raven 
Use with Kirides Gothic 2 GD3D11 v17.7-dev20 Mod

Place the mods in the System Folder where the games exe is along with reshade and the shaders.

Launch with GothicStarter.exe

Make sure Copy Depth is selected in the API Tab/GenericDepth addon.

The link is for both.
https://github.com/kirides/GD3D11/releases/tag/v17.7-dev20

{Grim Dawn}
For this game I say you should use the FlashBack shader. Since it gives a better sence of Depth for this type of game. You also need to select the right Depth Buffer so that it does
not go blank when you interact with people. This should be under the DX11 Tab in the newest ReShade. 

{GTA 5} [Reshade ReShade 4.5.4+]
Rename the dxgi.dll too d3d11.dll for DX11 mode or just install it as d3d9.dll.
If the game is crashing in fullscreen. Switch over to Window or Borderless window mode.

So for the mini map go to setting then display.
Radar <Blips> or <Off>
Off if you get the black box in the sky issue.

In this case enable MSAAX2
Set PostFX to normal.

Now the issue of Chromatic Aberration sadly I can't correct for this that easy. You are going to have to download a disable CA removal mod.
Can't see out windows issue. You have to switch the depth buffer to something else. In the DX11 tab

If CA issue really bothers you and you don't want to install any mods you can try the Legacy_Mode in shader set it from 0 to 1

{Half-Life 2} [Reshade 5.0.2]
So In this game The newer reshades seems to have more issues in this game. I hear 4.4.0 "seems" to be better in this game. But, Even with the extra options for source games it drops off in some points.

You can select your own depth buffer or use auto preserve. Some users noted that auto preserve drops out more. But, seems pick the right depth buffer kind of ok.
Make sure to turn off MSAA in game options.

If you can't stand the flickering set this command in console r_3dsky 0
This should stop the flickering at a cost of the backdrop.

I say to just use the latest. You can also use mods like the MMOD with Half-Life 2: Update
But, you still need to use r_3dsky 0

DGVooDoo2 not working nor DXVK.
 
{Hard Reset}
Must Enable FSAA for depth buffer access.

{Hat in Time} [Reshade 4.5.3]
I suggest leaving MLAA and dissable DOF and any other blurs and distortions in game settings. It uses DX9 and make sure you set reshade depth buffer to copy. If you don't you will be
stuck with a low resolution depth buffer. 

{Hedon}
This game has build in 3D Options.

GZ Does not draw Sprites in the Depth Buffer So you have to use in game 3D options.
Adjust them in the Options. Then fine tune them with. 

vr_mode "#"
vr_swap false
//following don't to seem to work anymore.
vr_weapon_height 0.0
vr_weapondist 0.6
vr_sprite_scale 0.4 //weapon size
vr_view_yoffset 4.0

Stereo Example & values to try.
For More information look at the mini guide below for GZDOOM.

{Hexen 2} - Hammer of Thyrion & jsHexen II
Open the games Config.cfg file in the data1 folder.

{Layers of Fear} - Used ReShade 4.3. But You should use an older version of reshade around 3.0 era
If you use modern Reshade then Select DX11 Tab and set the Depth Buffer settings to.
Depth Texture Formant - D24S8
Depth Buffer - to the one with 0 Draw Calls

Helps to look at a lamp or light to get that buffer to stand still. You will know what I mean.

{LEGO Batman 3}

{Little Nightmares} - Used ReShade 4.3
In setting set Post Processing to low ore Med.

{Lost Planet: Extreme Colonies} [Reshade 4.6.1] 
Used DgVoodoo2 for Dx9
Make sure to launch your game and set it up with ReShade dxgi.dll and use DgVoodoo2 to convert DX9 to DX11.
This is done so you have less problems when running this game with ReShade.

{Lost Planet 3} [Reshade 4.6.1]
May need to alt-tab to get a better depth buffer at native rez. Also make sure you use Copy Depth funtion under the DX9 Tab

{LuciusII}
Set Globla Settings to Medium. Turn off FXAA Every thing else can be maxed out.

{LUST for Darkness} [Reshade 4.3]
You need to set DX11 Depth Texture Formant to D32FS8.
Also select the first Buffer.

{Mafia II Definitive Edition} [Reshade 4.6.1+]
A Delay Frame option was added to the shader as work around for the bluring issue casued by the delayed Depth buffer. Expect that one frame of latency.
This should be around 16.6ms at 60fps and 8.325ms at 120fps good thing this game can run really well on modern hardware.

You need to enable "Copy Depth Buffer Before Clear Operation," in side of ReShade to have a working depth buffer.

{RESIDENT EVIL HD BIOHAZARD HD}
The DepthBuffer issues force you to play in 4:3. Because, in 16:9 mode The depth buffer will never match the BackBuffer. Some issues with Clipping by the game is totaly playable.

Should not need to do this. But, you may want to mod this game anyways.
https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Resident_Evil_HD_Remaster#Essential_improvements

{RESIDENT EVIL 2  BIOHAZARD RE2 Remake}
Enable RE_Fix in shader "USER EDITABLE PREPROCESSOR FUNCTIONS."
To do this open up the shader and set RE_Fix to 1.

Should not need to do this anymore. Use Overwatch.fxh

{Resident Evil 7}
Make sure Render Mode is Normal.
Also Scale should be 1 for 1:1.

{Return To Castle Wolfenstine}
Increase Depth to 25+ Do this by typing in your amount.
The game seems to run really slow with my shader at the start. 
This may be a problem with my old card.
But, Wait untill the frame rate stablizes. Then play the game.

Setting you want to change if you want to play at 4k.

Look in your config to see what you need to change. wolfconfig.cfg
Ex.
seta r_customaspect "1"

seta r_customheight "2160"

seta r_customwidth "3840"

seta r_fullscreen "1"

seta r_mode "-1"

If you have nGlide installed.
seta r_glIgnoreWicked3D "1"
or just set your res to 800x600 and set your res in nGlide to your native res. I say use nGlide it looks better and you get to see the in game movies.

{Requiem: Avenging Angel}
Use nglide 1.05 or 1.04 to run this game.

{Serious Sam Fusion} [Reshade 4.6.1]
- Needs Online Code Disabled for online play. DX12/Vulkan/DX11 all seem to work.
In some maps you need to set Offset back to 0.0 so that you can have proper Depth. You would also need to set it back to 0.1 on other maps. Be mindfull of this.

{Shadow of the TombRaider}
This game has it's own 3D Side by Side mode That renders around half and disabled some effects like AO. This mode has superior convergence/ZPD AKA Pop Out. 
My suggestion is to play in native 3D Side by Side mode. But, Set the game resolution to 25% to 50% more and use MXAO as you AO in game.

If your system can't handle the previous setting. Use Depth Clues and a sharpen with a better form of AA.

A note for HMD Users. You need to limit pop out to the edge of your screen.
You Don't want a mini Lara Croft In your skull do you? 

SLI scaling Is good in this game. Almost full scaling on both cards. If you want to brute force FPS.

{Soldier of Fortune} [Reshade 4.5.2]
Download and use the SoF Plus patch. Then Delete QeffectsGL.dll and rename ReShade opengl32.dll to QeffectsGL.dll.
Get it here https://sof1.megalag.org/sofplus/

In game max out all the settings and set your resolution you need. Apply settings
Then set Video Driver : Default OpenGL to QeffectsGL (QFX)

..\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat\bin\xrEngine.exe 
First Start the Game with out modding and set the settings.
Please install the Complete Mods since I did all my testing with this mod.
Most of the games have problems running in Windows 10 and Long Load times. Run in Compatilbility Mode Windows XP (Service Pack 3) and DPI scaling.

In Windows 10 Anniversary Delete the files in the "prefecth," folder. SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Stalker Call of Pripyat\gamedata\configs\prefetch This folder should stay empty. 
It normaly contains prefetch.ltx and or prefetch_single.ltx in the folder. 
You should not need Compatilbility Mode.

Now in Windows 10 Creators update you want to disable Compatilbility Mode.

{Clear Sky}
..\S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Clear Sky\bin\xrEngine.exe 
Run in Compatilbility Mode Windows 7 and DPI scaling. First Start the Game with out modding and set the settings. First load should take a long time.

Now there is one more issue I could not fix was the On screen action button may be hard to read sometimes....... Good luck with that.

{The Forest} [Reshade 4.3]
Depth Buffer Hides some times Need to look for it in the DX11 Tab. Keep a low Divergence lower then normal in this game.
Also something to note. Depth Buffer is lost sometimes out in open waters. I find that setting Depth Settings as bellow help.

Under DX11 Tab
Depth Texture Formant: D32FS8
Depth Buffer: 0x00000000082ED0FD8 like the 4th one down.

Right click the EvilWithin.exe
Go to Compatibility
Check Disable Display Scaling On High DPI Settings

This should fix it. For more look up this problem on google.

I would say also use an FOV fix. Like the one found at http://www.flawlesswidescreen.org/#Download.

{The Legend of Korra}

Guide Here.

{The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild} 
- Note:  I will not show you how to set up the emulator or the Rom. This part on you. But, If you love the game buy it on console.
First set up the shader as the above settings then.

ReShade it self has issues when you enter a menu to change your weapon/clothes/Stuff. 
To fix this follow this procedure.

Start up CEMU and the enter the game world. Then go back to the CEMU program.
In CEMU to Options. In this Pull-Down Menu click on Separate Gamepad View.
Once this is done go back in to the game and go back to your items Menu.
If going back to your items menu does not give you depth try pressing down on your right stick on your Wii U game Pad or what ever your using to play the game.
The press it again.

This should fix your problem.

If it's stuck with no Depth Try moving it in window mode and resizing it then going back to fullscreen Mode

I also noticed a bug in 1.12.1+ in CEMU that still has not been fixed. DepthBuffer is switching making it unplayable in 3D. 
So if you want to play in 3D use CEMU 1.12.0d It's the latest one I know so far that works.
Do Not Ask me for this version & Yes you should be able to finnish the game with this version of cemu.

You will also need to use a resolution graphics pack form here. https://slashiee.github.io/cemu_graphic_packs/ (Older Version 2)

{The Park} [Reshade 4.4.2]
This Has Some Depth Buffer issues in cutscenes. Also you need to find a way to disable the depth of field
The good is that, Unreal 4 engine games do indeed have DepthOfField line in SystemSettings section of UDKSystemSettings.ini. That can 
controls mainly depth of field effects. But, may not work you have to test this.

{The Surge} 
- Thank you zig11727
Install Directory \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\The Surge\bin

{The Swapper} [Reshade 4.9 as opengl32]
So issues with the game with needing the user to select the correct depth buffer in the API Tab. But, also it will be needing alignment and resizing. 
This is done with overwatch.fxh. But, maybe you can do it better. The other issue is with depth in  dark areas of the cave, the dev didn't place a primitive there. 
So this means the dark areas where there should be a wall, instead it will be set to Max depth. It looks like it was an optimization................. 
But, because of this it will cause eye strain.

{The Suicide of Rachel Foster} [Reshade 4.9.1]
Game runs fine issues with DoF and/or other effects.

To Disable PostProcessing effects in TSoRF

Head over to C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Daedalic Entertainment GmbH\The Suicide of Rachel Foster\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor
Open the “Engine.ini” file

So on here at the bottom.

Add:
[SystemSettings]
r.DepthOfFieldQuality=0
r.MotionBlur.Max=0
r.MotionBlurQuality=0
r.DefaultFeature.MotionBlur=0
r.SceneColorFringeQuality=0

Save the file and set it to Read Only. 

Keep in mind if you change your setting in game you need to restart so that this INI can remove the problem Post Effects.

{The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Redux}
May Have an issue with the Title screen. Ignore this. In game it fine.
Instal Dll too D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Redux\EthanCarter\Binaries\Win64

{The Void} [Reshade 3.0.3]
You may need to install the other things in the game folder for the game to run such as DX9 runtime and AdbeRdr810_en_US. Also the PhysX run time if you are on AMD. I know, I know...... But, this was the only way I got it to run in windows 10 on AMD Hardware.

{Through The Woods} [Reshade 3.4.1]
In game Set your Res to Native screen Res.

{Titanfall 2} [Reshade 4.0.2]
Install ReShade into the Bin/x64_retail folder. 

In game settings:
Adaptive Resolution FPS Target = 144
Adaptive Supersampling = Enabled

{Rise of the TombRaider | TombRaider 2013} [Reshade 4.6.1+]
You may need to manually enable copy depth buffers in the ReShade DX11 menu for the games listed here.

{Turok: Dinosaur Hunter} [Reshade 3.4.1]
If you are useing an older build of reshade you have to turn off "Light Scatter," in Graphics Menu.

{Vanquish} [Reshade 4.7.0]
Use DGVoodoo2 for this game to convert dx9 to dx11.

Settings used in DGVooddoo2 are "Resolution" Set your resolution here and not in game due to a bug that comes up if you set your res in game.
Set MSAA to Off and VRAM to Max 2048MB. Optional you can disable the DGVoodoo Logo if you like.

This is done so you don't have to scale the depth buffer your self.

You can download DGVoodoo2 here http://dege.freeweb.hu/dgVoodoo2/dgVoodoo2.html

{Void Bastards} [Reshade 4.7.0]
Issues with MSAA and Weapon Hand not Showing up in the Depth Buffer.
You have to set the game to the lowest graphics settings to disable MSAA.

{Unreal Gold}
Use v227 patch. Use the DX9 render. Install Rehsade 3.0 to System folder select DX9.
In Unreal Set your res and the go to advance settings.
Turn Off AA and go back in to the game. Start a game.

{Watch Dogs 2} 
or use the white listed reshade version.
Go to the WatchDog2.exe and use compatibility mode.
Set it too Windows 8.
Install reshade and use dxgi.dll
Ok befor you launch use this command.
-eac_launcher <---- as the start up command.

{World of Warcraft} [Reshade 4.4 with DX12 and Network check disabled dll] 
First Do not ask me for this DLL. You have to find it on your own or make your own. Don't ask me for this.

Now I suggest you use use The Mouse Pointer Guide above and to make a Custom UI mask for SuperDepth3D and bind it to the key you want. You can Make a total of 2 UI masks.

Other thing I suggest is to dissable Outlines Highlighting in WoW.

{Wolfenstine: Games} [Reshade 4.1.1]
[Set Launch Options](+r_multisamples "0" +vt_maxaniso "16")
This game must be started at the lower Resoution 1600x1200 Windowed, Then Switch to 1920x1080 Fullscreen Windowed. 
Befor you exit switch it back to 1600x1200 Windowed.
 
Note if you want to 4k It's the same process Start the game at 1600x1200 Windowed then switch it to 3840x2160 Fullscreen Windowed.
Also note you can't switch back. 

So say you Start the game at 1600x1200 then switch to 4k then back too 1600x1200 it will not work. If you don't have this resolution.
Create it your self.
You must restart your game for eatch change of resolution.

Update 2018: Running it in Windows 10 Disable Scaling to avoid problems.

In order to completely disable DOF:

open up graphicsprofiles.json and find the postprocessdof line and change high and ultra to 0. \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Wolfenstein.The.New.Order\base\graphicsprofiles.json

Should look like this;
Ex.
"r_postProcessDofMode" : 
	{ 
		"low" : 0,
		"mid" : 0,
		"high" : 0,
		"ultra" : 0
	},
Update 7.23.2019 When testing with AMD cards the depth buffer seems to not be accessable. I don't know why it's not working.
	
{You Are Empty}
Read Here you will need patch 1.2 and 1snd.

{Dead Space} [retested 10/21/2019]
Games Depth Buffer does not show till after the elevator part at the start. Depth Buffer also goes away when interacting with some objects and when you get video feeds.
I suggest useing TriDef. For this game.

{Monstrum}
Start the game in OpenGL or DX3D mode. Game seems to change Depth Buffer now after update. I suggest useing TriDef.

{Portal 2} -Game crashes when loading-
Install to the Bin Folder DX9.
Max out everything. Turn off AA
Open the console.
Type in console;
 
sv_cheats 1
bind 3 "r_drawvgui 1"
bind 2 "r_drawvgui 0"

Once in game press 2 and you should have acess to a Depth Map.
Game Crashes if you leave r_drawvgui 0 when you die. Don't know how to fix this.

{Left 4 Dead 2} [Game Depth Buffer is unstable]

{Shadow warrior(2013)}
 DM 5        2.5-5.0
Depth Buffer only in DX9 so launch it in Shadow Warrior XP and turn on FSAAX2 in game.

{Yume Nikki -Dream Diary-} [Reshade 4.4]
ReShade Has a hard time picking the best Depth Buffer......... Sometimes you can't get the best Depth Buffer.

{Zombi} [Depth map Pops in and out]
This Problem seems to happen when looking at one direction. Don't know why it happens. 
But, I suggest useing a othere 3D application like Tridef or Nvidia 3D Vision.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Also Keep in mind if you don't like the depth map I made. You can alawys make your own.

For older versions of reshade.
https://www.mediafire.com/folder/8ar1jhh1809cl/ReShade_Repository

Here is a quick and dirty game list of working Depth Maps. They are only suggestions. You can use any setting that works for you.
